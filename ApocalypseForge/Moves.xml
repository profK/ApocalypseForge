        <CriticalFailure>Not only does the actor fail to impress the target of their 
            point of view, but the target thinks they are a phony. The actor has -1D6 to

            of the episode</CriticalFailure>

                <Option>The target thinks the actor is fill of themselves. The actor's 
                    +1D6 is nullified and the target takes 2 points of stress from social 
                    consequences.</Option>
                <Option>The target will go along with the target, but they expect a favor
